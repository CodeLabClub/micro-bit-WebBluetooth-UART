# micro-bit-WebBluetooth-UART

Demo send & receive data with micro:bit Web Bluetooth UART service.

I created a simple demo to send and receive data with m:bit UART service. The code is purely written in the JavaScript block PXT editor and the HTML5 app for the web bluetooth app running on Chrome browser.
